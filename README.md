## Overview

Are We Friends? Garden is a web-based application designed to assist gardening enthusiasts in planning and optimizing their garden beds. By mapping out plants and their compatibility, users can create harmonious and thriving garden layouts.

## Features

- **Interactive Mapping:** Users can add plants onto a virtual garden bed, creating a visual representation of their garden layout.

- **Companion Planting Guide:** Access to an extensive companion planting database, suggesting which plants grow well together and which should be kept apart.

- **Compatibility Testing:** The application checks for compatibility between selected plants and provides recommendations based on well-established gardening principles.

- **Customizable Layouts:** Users can adjust the garden bed's dimensions and customize plant arrangements to suit their preferences.
